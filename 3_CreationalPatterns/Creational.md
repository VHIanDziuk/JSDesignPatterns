# Creational Patterns in JS

Creational design patterns focus on object creation mechanisms. 
These patterns help manage object instantiation, encapsulate the creation 
logic and promote code reuse. The primary purpose of creational patterns 
is to separate the logic of object creation from the rest of the code. 

Common creational patterns include Singleton, Factory, and Constructor 
patterns, which can be implemented using functions, closures, 
and prototypes. Using these patterns in JavaScript leads to more 
maintainable, flexible, and scalable code.

## We will be examining two patterns
- Singleton
- Factory
