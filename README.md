# JavaScript & Design Patterns


**üîç OBJECTIVE**

First, we're going to cover some JS concepts, then we're going
to examine some design patterns using JavaScript. *(Note: Not all patterns
can be easily translated to other languages ex: C#)* This will not be a
deep dive on each topic, but hopefully it will be enough to catch your
interest.


**üéØ GOAL**

To re-examine how we think about how we use JS in our day-to-day work 
and look for possible solutions to problems that we've identified.



## JavaScript Topics

The JS topics discussed are specific, isolated, and mostly
basic stuff you will probably encounter in Virtix software.

- Variable Scopes
- Classes VS IIFE Pattern



## Design Patterns
The patterns discussed are specific to Vanilla JS. For each, 
we will discuss the name, the problem it was designed to solve 
and the consequences for using each.

- Creational Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Behavioral Patterns
